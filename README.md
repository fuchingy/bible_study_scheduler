# bible_study_scheduler

--Motivation--

  There are available Bible study progress on the internet, but none
of them can be customized for an individual. They all have problems
as follows:

  * Assumed fixed length, such as 1-year or 2-year
  * No start/end date
  * Cannot proactively remind you today's progress
  * Combined old and new testment progress
  * Only physical paper copy

--Goal--

  This project provides a tool, for users to inject their customized
Bible study progress into the Google calendar. This achieves the
following goals:

  * Customized progress length, e.g., 1-month, 2-seasons, 1.5-year, and so on.
  * Customized start and end date
  * Configurable pop-up reminder for today's progress
  * Independent old and new testment progress
  * Enable progress check everywhere with cell phone, tablet, or PC.
